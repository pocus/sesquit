    <h6 class = "subheader explanation">
      In 1958 London Ontario’s Public Utilities Commission undertook the
      construction of a major area attraction: Storybook Gardens. One of the
      premiere attractions was to be a pair of sea lions, who stood at the ready
      while construction on the park was completed. However, a faulty fence
      allowed one of the sea lions to escape. Dubbed “Slippery” by a gasping
      press corps, the intrepid pinniped managed to get into the Thames River
      and make it as far as Sandusky Ohio (400km away), all the while being
      pursued by reporters and local authories. He was eventually shot with a
      tranquilizer gun while sleeping in a boat house and returned to London to a
      joyous crowd of fifty thousand people.

      <p class = "annotation">London took a significant
financial risk in building Storybook Gardens, so much so that some people suspect that the story of Slippery was
a conspiracy designed to draw
attention to the park. The
Toledo Ohio zoo did stage a
phony custody dispute after
capturing Slippery, which only
added to the furor. If the whole
thing was a setup it worked
very well indeed. Today a
children’s waterpark at the site
bears Slippery’s name.</p>
